GLMMs allow researchers to use
the dependent variable most appropriate to their research
question, while simultaneously meeting the mathematical
criterion of normalized, homoscedastic residuals in linear
regression. 
GLMMs combine and extend the properties of LMM and
generalized linear model (GLM) approaches, by relaxing LMM’s
assumption that the dependent variable (and the residuals) follow
a normal (Gaussian) distribution, and extending GLM’s scope of
inference to extend beyond a single random population. Rather
than making the default assumptions of LMM methods, GLMM
requires researchers to specify a number of components of their
data and design:
   (1) the explanatory variables responsible for systematic variation
in responses: referred to as the fixed factors;

(2) the sampling structure of the design contributing to random
variability in responses: the random factors;
(3) the probability distribution describing the plausible
processes underlying the observed data: the distribution of
the dependent variable; and
(4) the mathematical function characterizing the relationship
between the fixed factors and the dependent variable: the link
function.
